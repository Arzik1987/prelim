This repo has emerged as a continuation of another [project](https://github.com/bobboman1000/gr_prim) that considers fewer generators.

Installing module with IREP and RIPPER classification rules learners with several bugs fixed:  
```pip install git+https://github.com/Arzik1987/wittgenstein.git@8378f58f17382a862f5839dcafa756dd2bc84c18```

Below is the example how to reproduce the experiments with Anaconda.

Use the following commands to set up the environment
```
conda create -n yourenv pip
conda activate yourenv
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```


### Testing the package contents
To run the generator tests, call <code>pytest</code> in the command line from the project root directoy.
